# UE_PacManGBC
Pacman game created in Unreal Engine. Just an example project done for school

## Installation
1. Download **[Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/)**. Make sure to have version 4.13 or higher downloaded (Preferably 4.13).

1. Install Git LFS.

1. Clone or fork repository.

1. Launch project through Unreal Engine or double click 'PacManGBC.uproject'.

## Contributions
This project is mostly for school so I don't expect anyone to contribute anything to this. But I will still look at any contributions (big or small) to the project through Pull Requests.

There is no coding standards as long as its readable or commented (preferably both).

Also it must compile.

## Additional Notes
Cloning the repository might take a while because of git LFS and may require multiple pulls since it might hang mid download. This should only happen on the initial cloning unless there is a big update.
